# SuperScanner-FinalProject
- The app will mainly focus on shared bikes. Ideally, the user should only register once into our app to have the access of our services. 
- The app should scan the QR code properly and redirect the users to the corresponding website. 
- The app also includes additional features, such as clickable maps and sending notifications about nearby nikes. 

Our main motivation comes from citibikes and wants to create a more convenience user experiences when it comes to bike sharing.
